    description: "The Ford Fusion Energi was a plug-in hybrid variant of the second-generation Fusion sedan. Based on the same CD4 platform as the standard Fusion, it combined a 2.0L Atkinson cycle four-cylinder engine with an electric motor and lithium-ion battery pack. The total system output was 188 HP, delivered through a continuously variable transmission (CVT) to the front wheels. The initial 7.6 kWh battery provided approximately 21 miles of electric-only range, later improved to 25 miles with a 9.0 kWh battery introduced in the 2019 model year. Charging took approximately 2.5 hours using a Level 2 (240V) charger or 7 hours with a standard 120V outlet. The Energi featured unique instrument cluster displays to monitor hybrid operation and energy usage, with selectable EV modes allowing drivers to choose when to use electric power. Visually similar to the standard Fusion except for charge port and badging, it maintained the sleek styling and comfortable interior of its conventional counterpart, though trunk space was reduced by the battery placement. Available in SE and Titanium (later Platinum) trim levels, it offered upscale features including leather seating, SYNC infotainment, and active safety technology. The Fusion Energi represented Ford's early commitment to electrification in mainstream vehicles, offering a balance of efficiency and practicality in a familiar package. Production ended alongside other Fusion models in 2020 as Ford shifted focus toward SUVs and fully electric vehicles."
